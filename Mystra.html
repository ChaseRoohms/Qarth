<h1>Mystra</h1>
<hr/>

<p>As a goddess, Mystra could shape change at will and mortals who saw her reported she changed constantly. Others
    described her appearing in a form resembling a multicolored will-o'-wisp. Mystra is The Mother of All Magic, The
    Lady of Might, and The Creator of All Things. Her greatest creation is life itself. The different planets of this
    world are Mystra’s planes, each one of them thriving with a different living community.
    <br/><br/>
    Mystra had a brother, Helm, the two were opposites. Mystra created, and Helm destroyed, an ouroboros constantly
    spinning. Eventually Mystra created something she didn’t want to see the world rid of, life.
    <br/><br/>
    The shear uniformity of inanimate objects makes their loss meaningless, a stone is a stone no matter how many times
    it has to be remade, but life has a way of forming differently each and every time around. Mystra was inspired by
    it. Each time Helm would take a creation from her before it lived to its full potential she wept for its loss, a
    snowflake that would never form the same way again. The two made a deal, everything she created would be destroyed
    by his hand, but only once it served its term in her realm. She created for him his own realm, The Outer Planes.
    Just as Mystra had many worlds in her realm, so too did Helm create many. The Nine Hells for most destructions, but
    for some that he took pity on, peaceful ending places, to spend their last moments.</p>
