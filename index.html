<h1>The Tumultuous Landscape of Qarth</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Drifting deep in the furthest expanses of Mystra's realm, is a planet known only as Qarth.
  Shrouded in evil and war for decades Qarth is not a land of peace and prosperity like our home Terron,
  nor a land of nature and opportunity like the beloved Terterra, but rather a tumultuous landscape of good vs evil
  conveniently divided by darkness and light.
  Qarth rotates slowly, casting one side of its globe into eternal shadow, and the other into eternal daylight.

  <br/><br/>
  From the dark side of the world rules The Tyrant of Twilight, Empress Morana, intent on taking over Qarth and ruling
  it as the one true Queen.
  Her influence is felt deep into the Lands of Light, as her magic and her armies of monstrous soldiers find their ways
  through the cracks in its defenses.
  Little is known of the dark side, as the forces of Light have never been on the offensive, but the select few who make
  it back from the border weave sickening stories.
  Twisted forests snake the lands for miles, echoing with the incessant cries of the creatures that sulk within their
  borders.
  Rivers of putrid liquid bubble with the stench of rotted festering flesh, breathing life into vile amphibious
  creatures that slog along their shorelines.
  The air hangs heavy and thick with fog, making the dark side even more difficult to navigate.

  <br/><br/>
  On the light side of the world sits Queen Saraphon, Lady of Light.
  Her forces stretch thin, and pale in comparison to those of Morana, but the will of the people of Qarth is strong.
  Queen Saraphon is merely the most recent head of the Lands of Light, one more in a long line of leaders unable to do
  more than delay Morana.
  Deep within the Lands of Light lie two major settlements, Solara and Helion, and stretched between them are many
  smaller villages and towns separated by lush grassland and a few scattered woods.
  Over the years less and less of the Land of Light is usable, as the forces of darkness wreak destruction upon the
  outskirts of the mainland.</p>
