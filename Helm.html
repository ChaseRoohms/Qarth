<h1>Helm</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Helm has always appeared as a tall man (14-20 feet) clad in full plate armor, the faceplate of his Helm concealing
    his face. A very old deity, Helm was the eternal sentry and was always seen wearing a full suit of armor that
    represented the weight of his heavy responsibility. Helmâ€™s responsibility was the ending of life. As mortals grow
    old, and gain power, they corrupt, the mortal soul was never meant to live an undying life.
    <br/><br/>
    Helm had a sister, Mystra, who created all things living. Helm followed forever behind her leaving a trail of death
    and destruction in his wake, none could be allowed to live forever. Each time Helm would take a creation from her
    before it lived to its full potential she wept for its loss, a snowflake that would never form the same way again.
    The two made a deal, everything she created would be destroyed by his hand, but only once it served its term in her
    realm. She created for him his own realm, The Outer Planes. Just as Mystra had many worlds in her realm, so too did
    Helm create many. The Nine Hells for most destructions, but for some that he took pity on, peaceful ending places,
    to spend their last moments.</p>
