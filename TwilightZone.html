<h1>The Twilight Zone</h1>
<hr/>

<p>From the dark side of the world rules The Tyrant of Twilight, Empress Morana, intent on taking over Qarth and ruling
    it as the one true Queen. Her influence is felt deep into the Lands of Light, as her magic and her armies of
    monstrous soldiers find their ways through the cracks in it's defenses. Little is known of the dark side, as the
    forces of Light have never been on the offensive, but the select few who make it back from the border weave
    sickening stories. Twisted forests snake the lands for miles, echoing with the incessant cries of the creatures that
    sulk within their borders. Rivers of putrid liquid bubble with the stench of rotted festering flesh, breathing life
    into vile amphibious creatures that slog along their shorelines. The air hangs heavy and thick with fog, making the
    dark side even more difficult to navigate.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Empress Morana</h3>
<p>According to history books, Morana has been around for centuries, the earliest mention of her dates back 600 years. 
    There is never much detail, but the brief descriptions are all the same. Evil incarnate, encased in metallic black 
    skin, with only the right side of her face looking remotely human. In her initial assault, Qarth was so unprepared 
    that half of the world was conquered before forces could assemble to halt her progress.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Army of Darkness</h3>
<p>Empress Morana keeps herself at a distance, conquering from the comfort of her fortress, it's location unknown. Her
    armies are formed of the strongest of Dark Side monsters, creatures whose origins are unimaginable. One thing is for
    certain though, they are not of this plane.
    <br/><br/>
    The Army of Darkness strikes without mercy, their movements almost mechanical. They are impervious to pain, and show
    no emotion in battle, fighting until their unnatural existence is ripped away from them by the Forces of Light. They
    seem not to have high intelligence of their own however, acting solely on the accord of their distant ruler.</p>
<br/>

<h3>The Terrain</h3>
<p>Little is known of The Dark Side past the border between the two lands, for the Forces of Light have never been able
    to enter and return safely. The most recent information describes rotten forests, and rivers of acid, but even this
    has not been verified in a few decades. The Twilight Zone could potentially be an entirely different world by now,
    and The Forces of Light would be none the wiser.</p>
