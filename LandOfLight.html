<h1>The Land of Light</h1>
<hr/>

<p>On the light side of the world sits Queen Saraphon, Lady of Light. Her forces stretch thin, and pale in comparison to
    those of Morana, but the will of the people of Qarth is strong. Queen Saraphon is merely the most recent head of the
    Lands of Light, one more in a long line of leaders unable to do more than delay Morana. Deep within the Lands of
    Light lie two major settlements, Solara and Helion, and stretched between them are many smaller villages and towns
    separated by lush grassland and a few scattered woods. Over the years less and less of the Land of Light is usable,
    as the forces of darkness wreak destruction upon the outskirts of the mainland.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Queen Saraphon</h3>
<p>Queen Saraphon is the most recent ruler of the Forces of Light, but there have been many before her. Their positions
    of power make The Land of Light's rulers easy targets for Morana's forces, so they rarely reach old age.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Previous Rulers</h3>
<p>Many have stood against The Empress, and many have failed, few of them noteworthy enough to be remembered after they
    are replaced. The first King however is still exalted in taverns across Solara and Helion, as the one reason Qarth
    ever stood a chance against The Empress. King Mathis, first of his name, a lowborn farmer who rallied the people of
    his small village to fight back against their assailants. He was the first to ever fell one of Morana's soldiers.
    He was living proof that this fight could be won.
    <br/><br/>
    News spread of his deeds, and the sheer willpower of Mathis drove the people of The Lands of Light to take up arms,
    forming the border between The Light Side and The Dark Side, between good and evil.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Solara</h3>
<p>Solara somehow maintains its classy nature through the horrors of war. The citizens of Solara are almost exclusively
    high-born, or of some political importance. If you do encounter a commoner they are likely a traveler from a
    neighboring village, or a shop keep of some sort. Solara is the most defended settlement in the Lands of Light, and
    houses Queen Saraphon herself.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Helion</h3>
<p>Helion makes no effort to hide its true colors, the majority of the citizens you encounter are either older or very
    young, as most able-bodied men and women are driven to the border to fight the ever raging war. Despite their unique
    makeup, Helion holds some of the richest traditions and happiest people. They make time for the small celebrations,
    the tavern songs and campfire tales.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Dawn's Rest</h3>
<p>Dawn's Rest is a small village outside Helion. Dawn's Rest hugs the outer wall of the main city, and is bordered on
    its other side by The Forests of Glendale. The village does not produce much other than it's share of crops, but
    makes up for it in its ample housing. Dawn's Rest frequently takes on soldiers looking for places to rest on their
    way to or from battles.</p>
